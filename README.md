## Summary:
This application is a lifestyle blog I created which is dedicated to the author's everyday life, interests, and activities. The blog author can create blog posts using the "Make New Post" form, which was created with Redux Form. Users can read all blog posts, comment on blog posts using the Disqus comments, contact the author by using the contact form (also made with Redux Form), and find blog posts with a specific tag. 

## Technologies used:
React.js, Redux, Javascript, Mocha, Chai, Disqus, SASS, Travis-CI
